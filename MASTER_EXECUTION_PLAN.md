# Master Execution Plan for GoldenSignalsAI
## AI-Powered Signal Generation & Hedge Fund Intelligence Platform

### Platform Definition (Final)

**GoldenSignalsAI is:**
- ✅ A **signal generation platform** that predicts market movements
- ✅ A **stock prediction system** using 30+ ML models  
- ✅ A **quant analyst platform** with institutional-grade analysis
- ✅ An **AI hedge fund brain** that makes recommendations (not trades)

**GoldenSignalsAI is NOT:**
- ❌ A trading execution platform (no buy/sell orders)
- ❌ A brokerage (no account management)
- ❌ A portfolio tracker (though it suggests allocations)

## Week 1: Foundation & First Signals

### Day 1: Enhanced Signal Model & Database
I'll enhance the existing signal model to support AI hedge fund capabilities while maintaining compatibility.

#### Task 1.1: Enhance Signal Model
```python
# Location: backend/models/signal_enhancements.py
# Add these fields to existing Signal model via migration:
- predicted_price: Float  # AI price prediction
- prediction_timeframe: String  # "1h", "1d", "1w"
- model_version: String  # Which ML model generated this
- feature_importance: JSON  # Top factors in decision
- alternative_data_signals: JSON  # Social, weather, etc.
- hedge_fund_strategy: String  # "momentum", "mean_reversion"
- sharpe_ratio: Float  # Risk-adjusted return metric
```

#### Task 1.2: Create Database Migrations
```bash
# Commands to execute:
cd backend
alembic revision -m "Add AI hedge fund fields to signals"
# Edit migration file to add new columns
alembic upgrade head
```

### Day 2: FinGPT Integration as MCP Agent

#### Task 2.1: Create FinGPT MCP Agent
```python
# Location: backend/agents/llm/fingpt_agent.py
# Conforming to existing MCP structure
```

#### Task 2.2: Integrate with Agent Orchestrator
```python
# Location: backend/agents/orchestrator.py
# Add FinGPT to agent registry
```

### Day 3: First ML Model - LSTM Predictor

#### Task 3.1: Implement LSTM Model
```python
# Location: backend/services/ml/lstm_predictor.py
# Target: 95% accuracy like huseinzol05's implementation
```

#### Task 3.2: Create MCP Tool Wrapper
```python
# Location: backend/mcp/tools/lstm_prediction_tool.py
# Wrap LSTM as MCP-compatible tool
```

### Day 4: Real-time Data Pipeline

#### Task 4.1: Enhance Market Data Service
```python
# Location: backend/services/market_data_service.py
# Add real-time streaming capabilities
```

#### Task 4.2: WebSocket Signal Broadcasting
```python
# Location: backend/api/websocket/signal_ws.py
# Broadcast new signals in real-time
```

### Day 5: Signal Generation Pipeline

#### Task 5.1: Multi-Model Ensemble
```python
# Location: backend/services/signal_generator.py
# Combine LSTM, FinGPT, and technical analysis
```

#### Task 5.2: RAG-Enhanced Context
```python
# Location: backend/rag/signal_context.py
# Add historical pattern matching
```

```

### Day 8-9: Risk Management System

#### Task 8.1: Portfolio Risk Calculator
```python
# Location: backend/services/risk/portfolio_risk.py
# Calculate VaR, Sharpe, Sortino ratios
```

#### Task 8.2: Position Sizing Agent
```python
# Location: backend/agents/risk/position_sizing.py
# Kelly Criterion + risk limits
```

### Day 10: Alternative Data Integration

#### Task 10.1: Social Sentiment Enhancement
```python
# Location: backend/services/alternative_data/
- reddit_sentiment.py (using FinGPT)
- news_sentiment.py (using FinGPT)
- options_flow.py
```

## Week 3: Production Optimization

### Day 11-12: Performance & Monitoring

#### Task 11.1: Signal Performance Tracking
```python
# Location: backend/services/performance_tracker.py
# Track accuracy, returns, win rate
```

#### Task 11.2: Production Monitoring
```python
# Location: backend/monitoring/
- signal_metrics.py (Prometheus metrics)
- alert_system.py (Critical alerts)
```

### Day 13-14: Advanced ML Models

#### Task 13.1: Implement Additional Models
```python
# Location: backend/services/ml/
- transformer_predictor.py
- xgboost_ensemble.py
- gru_attention.py
```

#### Task 13.2: Model Registry & Versioning

# Location: backend/api/docs/
# OpenAPI specs for all endpoints
```

#### Task 15.2: Frontend Integration
```python
# Ensure all WebSocket events documented
# Test signal flow end-to-end
```

## Implementation Order (Starting Now)

### 1. Database Enhancement (Today)
Let me create the migration for enhanced signal fields:

```python
# backend/alembic/versions/add_hedge_fund_signals.py
```

### 2. FinGPT Integration (Today)
Create FinGPT agent conforming to MCP standards:

```python
# backend/agents/llm/fingpt_agent.py
```

### 3. LSTM Model (Tomorrow)
Implement high-accuracy LSTM predictor:

```python
# backend/services/ml/lstm_predictor.py
```

Let me start implementing these components...
