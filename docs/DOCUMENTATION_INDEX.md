2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the system
3. Check `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` to see what's built
4. Follow `docs/RUNNING_THE_APP.md` to run the project

### For Implementation:
1. Use `docs/CLAUDE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` as the main guide
2. Follow `docs/CLAUDE_DETAILED_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for specific tasks
3. Reference `docs/QUICK_START_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for MVP features

### For Claude AI:
Provide Claude with:
